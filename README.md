#DriveOff
This is the development environment of the static front end for Drive Off.

This is an angular app created from the Angular Seed Project and then modified for this purpose.

The back end files are in another repo.

The production files are copies of most of the files in the app folder, but we have used gulp to minify them for the front end, and the final production files are in another repo.

#Start repo

`$ npm install`

`$ bower install`

`$ npm start`
